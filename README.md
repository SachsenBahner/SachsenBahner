# Hello, I'm Cedric!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a student pursuing a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering at HKA Karlsruhe. I have a keen interest in image processing using Python and I am currently working on an exciting project involving an ESP32, an LED matrix, and machine learning using MicroPython 🐍.

## About Me

🎓 Studying Electrical Engineering at HKA Karlsruhe  
💻 Passionate about image processing and Python  
🔬 Exploring the intersection of hardware and machine learning  
🤝 Collaborating with a fellow student on the Vier-Gewinnt project  
🚂 Interested in 3D printing and designing custom circuits for model railways  
🌱 Constantly learning and seeking new challenges

## Projects

### Vier-Gewinnt game with ESP32-C3 and LED Matrix
In this project, my fellow student and I are developing a Vier-Gewinnt (Four in a Row) game using an ESP32-C3 microcontroller and an LED matrix. We are implementing machine learning techniques with MicroPython to make the game more intelligent and challenging. The goal is to create an interactive and visually appealing gaming experience.

Technologies Used
- ESP32-C3 microcontroller
- WS2812b LED stripes for the matrix
- Python
- MicroPython
- Machine Learning

### 3D Printing and Custom Circuit Development for Model Railways
Aside from the Vier-Gewinnt project, I am also involved in 3D printing model trains and designing custom circuits for my model railway hobby. I enjoy creating unique and personalized components for my model railway setup. An example would be a circuit with an Attiny to detect a train and close the level crossing.
